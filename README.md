# LapWarmer
Maybe it's a cold day. You're working outside, enjoying the scenery, but the frigid breeze keeps interrupting your work.
Or you might be you're indoors, but the AC system in this café seems to be on overdrive.
Or perhaps you're on a plane, thousands of feet away from the warmth of Earth's surface.

In any of these cases, you might wish you had a device that could strip you of your misery. 
Some apparatus that might emanate warmth? Something to thaw your legs?

Wait no longer. LapWarmer is an application with a very simple goal: to make your laptop heat up. 
Although this is not typically desireable, sometimes you're just feeling cold.
Personally, I can say LapWarmer has prevented frostbite dozens of times. 
(Advanced usage: hold your fingers under the laptop for a bit to warm them up too!)

# How it works
LapWarmer spawns 100 proprietary, patent-not-pending UltraWarmth™ threads. 
Each thread tirelessly increments an integer as quickly as possible. With some luck, nearly 100% CPU should soon be in use.

That's it. It's 21 lines of code.
